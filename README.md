## **Features**
Why settle for long, confusing links? With this URL shortener, you can:
- **Shrink URLs** effortlessly into compact, manageable links.
- **Monitor click performance**—every short URL keeps track of how many times it’s been used.
- **View past URLs** in a sleek, organized table with short IDs, original URLs, and click counts.

## **Getting Started**
Ready to jump in? Let’s get this up and running in no time.

### **Prerequisites**
- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)—your engine.
- A favorite **code editor** or IDE—your canvas.
- **MongoDB** (v4.4 or higher)—your trusty storage.

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the magic**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener.git
   ```
2. **Step inside** the project:
   ```bash
   cd url-shortener
   ```
3. **Gather your tools**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Ensure **MongoDB** is installed and running to store your URLs.

### **Running the Application**
1. Ignite the engine:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
2. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8001`. The magic begins here!

## **Usage**
It’s as simple as **type, click, and go**:
- Enter any long URL in the input field and hit the “**Generate**” button.
- A clean, short URL will be revealed.
- Click on the short URL and **zoom!** You’re instantly redirected to the original link.
- Watch the **click counter** climb as your URLs gain attention.

## **Code Structure**
This project’s code is as clean as the URLs it creates. Here’s how it’s laid out:

- **views/**: Houses the beautiful EJS templates that bring the front end to life.
- **public/**: Contains your CSS and JS—everything static and stylish.
- **routes/**: Where the magic happens—these handle your app’s routes.
- **app.js**: The brain that connects it all.
- **models/**: Defines your MongoDB schema for storing all the URL goodness.

## **Database**
All your shortened URLs live comfortably in a **MongoDB** database, complete with their click counts. The key files are:
- **url.model.js**: Defines how URLs are structured in the database.
- **url.controller.js**: Handles all the behind-the-scenes operations like creating, reading, and tracking URLs.

## **Template Engine**
This app uses **EJS**—allowing dynamic content to blend seamlessly with static HTML.

- **index.ejs**: The main canvas for your web app’s home page, where you interact with your URLs.

## **License**
This project is licensed under the **MIT License**. Check the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full legalese.

## **Contributing**
We’re always open to more magic! If you have a great idea or a fix, here’s how you can contribute:
1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Create a branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature
   ```
3. **Commit your changes** with style:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add amazing feature"
   ```
4. **Push** your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/amazing-feature
   ```
5. Submit a **pull request** and share your brilliance!

## **Example Use Cases**
- **URL Shortening**: Instantly turn long, unwieldy URLs into short and sweet links.
- **Redirection**: Effortlessly direct users to their destinations via your custom short URLs.
- **Analytics**: Track and display the performance of each short URL through the click counts.

## **Commit Messages**
Your commit messages are as important as your code. Here are some tips to keep them sharp:
- Use present tense: "Add feature", not "Added feature".
- Use imperative mood: "Fix bug", not "Fixes bug".
- Keep it short and sweet: Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Be generous with references to issues or pull requests.

## **API Documentation**
Document your endpoints with swagger! Ensure details like:
- Request and response formats.
- Error-handling mechanisms are clear for anyone who’s diving into your code.

## **Security**
Your app is short, but its security is strong:
- **HTTPS**: Keep data safe in transit.
- **Input validation**: Prevent vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- **Secure password hashing**: If your app ever handles passwords, ensure they’re hashed and salted.

## **Acknowledgments**
This app wouldn’t be possible without:
- **Express.js**—for making server-side logic smooth.
- **MongoDB**—for storing everything cleanly.
- **EJS**—for bringing dynamic content to life.
- **Node.js**—the backbone of it all.
